#Shopping List

##Instructions
This is a simple shopping list app, you can add items and remove items.

Before you start, remove the current list item (item 1), that's just an example item.

##What you will need
* You will need jQuery click listeners
* You will need Arrays to keep track of your items
* You will need Array.push to add items and Array.splice to remove items
* Loops to render the items

##Further Challenge
Add a filter input field and as the user types, it filters the results.  You will need to use the 'indexOf' function.

##Good Luck
